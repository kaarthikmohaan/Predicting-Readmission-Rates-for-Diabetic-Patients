# Predicting-Readmission-Rates-for-Diabetic-Patients
Develop a machine learning model to predict early hospital readmissions for diabetic patients, prioritizing high recall to minimize false negatives and improve healthcare outcomes through timely identification of at-risk individuals.

# Project Objective's

Accurately Predict Readmission Rates: Develop a machine learning model to identify early hospital readmissions for diabetic patients with high accuracy and recall.
Prioritize Patient Safety: Focus on minimizing false negatives to ensure timely identification of at-risk patients, improving healthcare outcomes and resource allocation.
Implement Robust Machine Learning Techniques: Leverage classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Decision Tree to analyze patient data and optimize performance metrics.
Enhance Model Performance: Apply hyperparameter optimization techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to achieve a recall of 92% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.87.
